Voting Behavior in the UN General Assembly
==================
In this project, I analyze all voting records from the UN General Assembly for 1946 - 2017 to see how often each country voted together with the United States on each resolution. I then compare each country's voting record to the amount of foreign aid that the country received from the US State Department. Surprisingly, foreign aid had virtually zero effect on a country's voting behavior. Even after adjusting for inflation, recency bias, and country demographic variables, spending billions of dollars in foreign aid did not have any statistically significant tendency to make countries more likely to agree with the USA in the General Assembly. Instead, countries were more likely to vote with the USA if they shared baseline economic indicators in common with the USA, such as a high GDP per capita, relatively low levels of economic inequality, and smaller levels of exports as a share of the country's total economy.
